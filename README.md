# Challange-1
First Challange

The website had been changed to include smaller screens. this is in the media type. When the screen size falls smaller then 768px the website will change style but keeping the infromation and buttons working as well as keeping a nice look.

Only one link was not working but that has been fixed, it did not inlcude where the link source.

The code is style.css just needed some clean up with a few lines of code being written muiltiple times when it only needed to be done once.
